- What a sinusoid is
- that striking a bar creates a sinusoidal sound

## What is sound?

Sound is a **vibration** which travels through a medium as

- **longitudinal** waves: gasses (e.g., air), liquids (e.g., water), and solids (e.g., concrete)
- **transversal** sound waves: solids (e.g., concrete)

The **speed of sound** depends on the medium.

In air at room temperature, for example, it is approximately 343 m/s.

Sound is normally divided into three types:

1. *Infrasound*: Sound with frequencies up to 20 Hz
2. *Audible sound*: Sound with frequencies in range 20 Hz - 20 kHz (*audio*)
3. *Ultrasound*: Sound with frequencies above 20 kHz

### Human hearing

The human ear consists of the following parts:

- **Outer ear**: Everything on the outside of the ear drum, including the pinna
- **Middle ear**: The three bones (Malleus, Incus, Stapes). What do they do?
- **Inner ear**: The cochlea (Latin for what?) tube. What does the basilar membrane do inside? Hair cells?

</center>

The human ear

- does not hear all frequencies equally well
- is most sensitive to frequencies around 4 kHz
- is tuned to speech
- has a really large dynamic range of up to ~120 dB (i.e., we can hear sound intensities up to ~10^12 the quietest sounds)

### Sinusoids

A sinusoid (or a sine wave) is given by

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\Omega t + \Phi)
$$

where

- $A\geq0$ is the **amplitude**
- $\Omega$ is the **frequency** measured in radians pr. second (SI symbol **rad/s**). Is related to the frequency $f$ measured in cycles pr. second (SI symbol **Hz**) via $\Omega = 2\pi f$.
- $t$ is the **time** measured in seconds (SI symbol **s**)
- $\Phi$ is the **initial phase** measured in radians (SI symbol **rad**)

The above form of the sinusoid is often referred to as the **polar form**. By using the angle addition formula for a cosine, i.e.,

$$
\cos(\theta+\phi) = \cos(\theta)\cos(\phi)-\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi)\ ,
$$

a sinusoid can also be written in a **rectangular form** as

$$
x(t) = a\cos(\Omega t) + b\sin(\Omega t)
$$

where a and b are scalars given by
\begin{align}
    a &= A\cos(\Phi)\\
    b &= -A\sin(\Phi)\ .
\end{align}

#### Numpy example: A sinusoid

```matlab
fs = 44100; % Hz
n = 0:1999;

% Generate a sinusoid
amp = 1;
freq = 100; % Hz
initPhase = pi/2; % rad
sinusoid = amp*cos(2*pi*freq*n/fs+initPhase);
 
% Plot the sinusoids
plot(n/fs, sinusoid)
xlabel('Time [s]')
ylabel('Amplitude')

```

#### Example: Generation of a sinusoid from a vibrating bar

Assume that the act of striking a bar is modelled as **compressing a spring** in one dimension.

From Hooke's law, this compresssion can be written as

$$
F(t) = -k x(t)
$$

where

- $F(t)$ is the **restoring force** measured in Newton (SI unit **N**)
- $x(t)$ is the **displacement** measured in meters (SI unit **m**) of the string from its resting position
- $k$ is the **spring constant** measured in N/m

From **Newton's second law**, the force can also be expressed as

$$
F(t) = ma(t)
$$

where

- $m$ is the **mass** of the string measured in kilogram (SI unit **kg**)
- $a(t)$ is the **acceleration** measured in m/s^2.

The acceleration is related to the displacement $x(t)$ as

$$
a(t) = \frac{dv(t)}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x(t)}{d t^2}
$$

where $v(t)$ is the **velocity** measured in m/s.

Combining these three equations gives

$$
-k x(t) = F(t) = ma(t) = m \frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2}
$$

which can be rewritten as

$$
\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2} = -\frac{k}{m} x(t)\ .
$$

This is a constant-coefficient second-order differential equation.

Let us check if our sinusoid

$$
x(t) = A\cos(\Omega t + \Phi)
$$

is a solution to the above differential equation. Since
\begin{align}
    \frac{dx(t)}{dt} &= -\Omega A\sin(\Omega t + \Phi)\\
    \frac{d^2 x(t)}{d t^2} &= -\Omega^2 A\cos(\Omega t + \Phi) = -\Omega^2 x(t)\ ,
\end{align}
we obtain

$$
-\Omega^2x(t) = -\frac{k}{m} x(t)\ .
$$

Thus, striking a bar will make it vibrate sinusoidally with the frequency

$$
\Omega = \sqrt{k/m}\ .
$$

This frequency can be changed by changing the spring constant and mass.

### Summary

- Sound is a vibration travelling through a medium.
- Sound waves are longitudal waves (and also transversal waves when travelling through a solid).
- The human ear converts pressure variations in the air to

1. mechanical movement (interface is the eardrum)
2. vibrations in a liquid (interface is the oval window)
3. electrical signal to the brain (interface is the haircells attached to the basilar membrane)

- A sinusoid (or sine wave) is given by

$$
x(t) = A\cos(\Omega t + \Phi)\ ,
$$

and it an extremely important building block (or atom) in analysing and manipulating sound.

- Assuming that striking a bar can be modelled as compressing a spring, the bar will vibrate sinusoidally.

## Complex numbers

In the next 20 minutes, you will learn

- that the equation

$$
x^2+1=0
$$

has two solutions

- what a complex number is
- how you add and multiply complex numbers

### The need for complex numbers

While the **linear** equation

$$
x + 1 = 0
$$

can easily be solved, the simple **quadratic** equation

$$
x^2 + 1 = 0
$$

was in high school said to have **no** solution since its descriminant was negative.

```matlab
nData = 100;
x = linspace(-2,2,nData);
y = x.^2+1;
plot(x,y)
xlabel('x')
ylabel('y')
ylim([-1,5])
grid on
```

![png](apLecture1_files/apLecture1_23_0.png)

However, the quadratic equation can in fact be solved by using **complex numbers**.

```matlab
YouTubeVideo('T647CGsuOVU') #5:47
```

></iframe>

Rearranging our simple **quadratic** equation gives

$$
x^2 = -1
$$

which allows us to write the solution as

$$
x = \pm\sqrt{-1} = \pm j
$$

where

$$
j = \sqrt{-1}
$$

is the **imaginary unit**. This unit also satisfies that

$$
j^2 = \sqrt{-1}^2 = -1\ .
$$

Note that

- **engineers** normally use the symbol $j$ for the imaginary unit
- **mathematicians** normally use the symbol $i$ for the imaginary unit.

Let us now consider the quadratic equation

$$
x^2 + 2x + 5 = 0\ .
$$

We know from high school that the solutions to the general quadratic

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0\ ,\qquad\text{for }a\neq0
$$

have the form

$$
x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{d}}{2a}
$$

where $d$ is the **discriminant** given by

$$
d = b^2-4ac\ .
$$

We obtain

$$
d = 4-20 = -16
$$

so that

$$
x = \frac{-2\pm\sqrt{-16}}{2} = -1\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{-1\cdot 4^2} = -1\pm 2\sqrt{-1} = -1\pm 2j\ .
$$

Thus, the **complex numbers** $-1+2j$ and $-1-2j$ are the solutions.

### The complex number

A **complex number** can be written as

$$
z = a + jb
$$

where

- $a = \text{Re}\{z\}$ is the **real** part
- $b = \text{Im}\{z\}$ is the **imaginary** part.

A complex number can be depicted in the **complex plane** which is a 2D coordinate system.

</center>

#### The complex conjugate

The **complex conjugate** of a complex number $z$ is

$$
z^* = a - jb\ .
$$

Thus, the conjugation operator ${}^*$ changes the sign of imaginary part, but not the real part.

#### Addition of complex numbers

Assume we have the two complex numbers
\begin{align}
    z_1 &= a_1+jb_1\\
    z_2 &= a_2+jb_2\ .
\end{align}

The **sum** of these two numbers is then

$$
z = z_1 + z_2 = a_1+jb_1 + a_2+jb_2 = (a_1+a_2) + j(b_1+b_2).
$$

Thus, the real and imaginary part of of $z=a+jb$ are simply
\begin{align}
    a &= a_1 + a_2\\
    b &= b_1 + b_2\ .
\end{align}

Note that
\begin{align}
    z_1 + z_1^* &= 2a_1 + 0j = 2\text{Re}(z_1)\\
    z_1 - z_1^* &= 0 + 2jb_1 = 2\text{Im}(z_1)\ .
\end{align}

#### Multiplication of complex numbers

Assume we have the two complex numbers
\begin{align}
    z_1 &= a_1+jb_1\\
    z_2 &= a_2+jb_2\ .
\end{align}

The **product** of these two numbers is then

$$
z = z_1z_2 = (a_1+jb_1)(a_2+jb_2) = (a_1a_2-b_1b_2) + j(a_1b_2+b_1a_2).
$$

Thus, the real and imaginary part of of $z=a+jb$ are
\begin{align}
    a &= (a_1a_2-b_1b_2)\\
    b &= (a_1b_2+b_1a_2)\ .
\end{align}

Note that

$$
z_1z_1^* = (a_1a_1-b_1(-b_1)) +j(a_1b_1-b_1a_1) = a_1^2+b_1^2 = \text{Re}(z_1)^2+\text{Im}(z_1)^2
$$

### Summary

- Complex numbers were originally invented to solve algebraic equations (e.g., the cubic equation)
- The imaginary unit is $j=\sqrt{-1}$
- A **complex number** $z$ consists of a real part $a$ and imaginary part $b$, and is written as

$$
z = a+jb\ .
$$

- The **complex conjugate** of $z$ is

$$
z^* = a-jb\ .
$$

- It is much easier to add two complex numbers than it is to multiply them.

### Exit Question

Let
\begin{align}
    z_1 &= a_1+jb_1 =  2+3j\\

\end{align}

By hand, please calculate
\begin{align}
    z_1 + z_2 &= \\
    z_1 - z_2 &= \\
    z_1 + z_1^* &= \\
    z_2 - z_2^*+2z_1 &= \\
    z_1z_2^* &=\\
    z_1^2+z_2^*z_1 &=
\end{align}

**Tip:** Use the rules
\begin{align}
    z_1 + z_2 &= (a_1+a_2) + j(b_1+b_2)\\
     z_1z_2 &= (a_1a_2-b_1b_2) + j(a_1b_2+b_1a_2)\ .
\end{align}

## Phasors

In the next 20 minutes, you will learn

- how a complex number can be written in a **polar form**
- why the polar form makes multiplications much easier
- what a **phasor** is
- how a phasor is related to a **real sinusoid**

### The polar (or exponential) form of a complex number

As for 2D vectors, we can also write a complex number in terms of its **magnitude** $r$ and **angle** $\psi$. We have
\begin{align}
    a &= r\cos\psi\\
    b &= r\sin\psi\ .
\end{align}
Thus,

$$
z = a + jb = r\left(\cos\psi + j\sin\psi\right) = r\mathrm{e}^{j\psi}
$$

where the last equality follows from **Euler's formula**.

</center>

#### Euler's formula

Given by

$$
\mathrm{e}^{j\psi} = \cos\psi + j\sin\psi\ .
$$

- A very important formula used everywhere in science and engineering
- Simplifies notation and mathematical manipulations
- Its real and imaginary parts are a cosine and a sine, respectively, i.e.,
  \begin{align}
  \text{Re}(\mathrm{e}^{j\psi}) &= \cos\psi\\
  \text{Im}(\mathrm{e}^{j\psi}) &= \sin\psi\ .
  \end{align}

<center>

</center>

#### The complex conjugate

The **complex conjugate** of a complex number

$$
z=r \mathrm{e}^{j\psi}
$$

is

$$
z^* = r \mathrm{e}^{-j\psi}\ .
$$

Thus, the conjugation operator ${}^*$ changes the sign of the angle, but not the magnitude.

#### Multiplication of complex numbers

Multiplication of complex numbers is much easier when the polar form is used. Let
\begin{align}
    z_1 &= a_1+jb_1 = r_1 \mathrm{e}^{j\psi_1}\\
    z_2 &= a_2+jb_2 = r_2 \mathrm{e}^{j\psi_2}\ .
\end{align}

The **product** of these two numbers is then

$$
z = z_1z_2 = r_1 \mathrm{e}^{j\psi_1}r_2 \mathrm{e}^{j\psi_2} = r_1 r_2 \mathrm{e}^{j\psi_1}r_2 \mathrm{e}^{j\psi_2} = r_1 r_2 \mathrm{e}^{j(\psi_1+\psi_2)}
$$

where we used $a^na^m = a^{n+m}$ to get the last equation.

Thus, to multiply two complex numbers we

- multiply their magnitudes
- add their angles

Note that **divisions** can be calculated as multiplications since

$$
\frac{z_1}{z_2} = z_1\frac{1}{z_2} = z_1 z_2^{-1}
$$

and

$$
z_2^{-1} = \frac{1}{r_2}\mathrm{e}^{-j\psi_2}\ .
$$

#### Converting between the rectangular and polar forms

We have seen that a complex number $z$ can be written as

$$
z = a+jb = r\mathrm{e}^{j\psi}\ .
$$

We can convert from the polar coordinates $(r,\psi)$ to the rectangular coordinates $(a,b)$ via
\begin{align}
    a &= r\cos\psi\\
    b &= r\sin\psi\ .
\end{align}

We can convert from the rectangular coordinates $(a,b)$ to the polar coordinates $(r,\psi)$ via
\begin{align}
    r &= \sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\
    \psi &= \mathrm{arctan2}(b,a)\ .
\end{align}

### The phasor

We have previously looked at the sinusoid

$$
x(t) = A\cos(\Omega t + \Phi)\ .
$$

Based on what we know about Euler's formula and complex numbers, we can now also write $x(t)$ as

$$
x(t) = \text{Re}\left[A\exp(j(\Omega t +\Psi))\right]
$$

since (from Euler's formula)

$$
A\exp(j(\Omega t +\Psi)) = A\cos(\Omega t +\Psi)+jA\sin(\Omega t +\Psi)\ .
$$

This time-varying complex number is called a **phasor** or a **complex sinusoid**.

Note that

- using the phasor instead of the real sinusoid makes life much easier (you will see this later in the course)
- even though we work with the phasor, we can always come back to the real sinusoid by taking the real part of the phasor

### Summary

- The **polar form** of a complex number $z=a+jb$ is

$$
z = r\mathrm{e}^{j\psi}
$$

where the magnitude $r$ and angle $\psi$ are given by
\begin{align}
    r &= \sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\
    \psi &= \mathrm{arctan2}(b,a)\ .
\end{align}

- Multiplications (and divisions) are much easier when using the polar form.
- A **phasor** is a complex sinusoid given by

$$
z(t) = A\exp(j(\Omega t +\Psi))\ ,
$$

and its real part is a real sinusoid, i.e.,

$$
x(t) = \text{Re}(z(t)) = A\cos(\Omega t +\Psi)\ .
$$
